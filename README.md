This is the Simon-Game.

The Simon game is the exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing 
the colored pads in the correct order. It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. 
Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels.
